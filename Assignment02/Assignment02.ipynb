In this notebook, we provide you with basic functions for completing the assignment.  *Complete the assignment in this notebook.  You will need to modify existing code and write new code to find a solution*.  Each member of the group must upload their own work (i.e., a notebook file) to GitHub.\n",

    "When solving a programming problem such as Problem 3 below, it is generally a bad idea to try and optimize your program in your first attempt. Rather than implementing clever algorithms right away, it is better to write a simple script that you are certain will work and is easier to debug. Once your script runs correctly (possibly with smaller input than the final problem you wish to solve), commit your working solution to your GitHub repository, then you can think about how to improve it."
